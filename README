The program works for Warrior 3, Double Warrior 3,
and Warrior 4. There is only one source code file,
queue.c which contains all the code for the
program.

To compile on wiliki:
	-run command: cc queue.c

To run program:
	-compile program then run a.out
	-when input is requested, submit
request.dat

The chief engineer should choose the Warrior 4 upgrade because it yields the most
marginal improvement of the two.
The Marginal improvement for Warrior 4 is 5,724,800 while doubling Warrior 3 yields an
improvement of 5,628,250.
For this reason I would choose the upgrade to Warrior 4 assuming the amount of customers
remains constant or imporves.
